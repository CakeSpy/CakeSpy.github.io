This thought is on a slightly different tangent than my previous posts, but I'll
run with it anyways.

How viable would it be to create a passive gas siphon on a gas giant by creating
a hollow space elevator?

When a person spins around in place with their arms outstretched, they can feel
the blood pressure increase in their finger tips. Likewise, the gravitational
force on Jupiter's surface would be strong enough to keep the gas giant
together, but the tip of a sufficiently tall bean stock would feel a
counter-gravity force greater than the force holding pulling it towards the
planet. To start the gas flowing through the bean stock, it would need to be
pumped through to the point the gas influenced by a stronger centripetal force
outweighed the gas under the stronger gravitational force.

All that goes under the assumption the gas weight could be overcome by its own
pressure. I haven't done the math yet, but here's a quick diagram of the
problem:

_(Insert diagram)_

1. Gas under stronger counter-gravitational force
2. Gas under stronger gravitational force
3. Gas giant

Wait... I just remembered gases expand to fit the volume they are given.
Never-mind about this idea- it won't work.
