The problem with the current design is that the vacuum in the middle might not
be strong enough to pull up the gas at the base. This can be fixed by adding a
ladder to the lower half of the siphon (where gravity is more influential than
centrifugal force on the gas). This is getting past my knowledge of physics, so
I need to talk to someone with more experience.

For the time being, I'll address the other issue with the design. How to keep the
tip of space elevator rotating around the planet?

This problem is caused by the conservation of momentum and fact that a circle's
circumference increases as its radius increases. When the gas is at the base of
the spigot, it is rotating around the planet's axis at _X_ rate. But the spigot
top must be traveling considerably faster because it is further away from the
axis of rotation. Initially the gas would be pushed forward by the tower's
momentum, but as more gas moving at _X_ speed is brought to the top of the tower
and sped up to _2X_, the tower will lose its momentum.

Like many things related to space, we can fix the problem
[with rockets](http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/141352/space-elevator-how-would-you-keep-the-end-of-a-space-elevators-cable-rigid).
That being said, there's a more efficient way. Once again, it depends on if the
tower is tall enough. Taller our tower is, the stronger the centrifugal force of
the materials traveling in it. There are 2 methods I'll explain:

1. As long as the tower is tall enough to accelerate the gas away from the
   planet at high enough speeds, we can
   [leak a variable amount of the gas out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_gas_thruster)
   one side of the tower. The gas being diverted in the trailing direction would
   propel the tip of the tower forward, keeping it aligned with the base.

2. The other option is to increase the mass at the tip of the tower. We can trap
   some of the gas as it reached the top to act as an orbiting anchor. This
   version of the tower relies on a heavy anchor at the tip of the tower, so it
   would be more complex to set up initially (when the tower is first filling
   with gas and has little wight at the top).

That's all for now. I plan on starting diagrams for this by the next blog post.
