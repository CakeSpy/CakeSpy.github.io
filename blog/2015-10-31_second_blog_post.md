## <span class="i">I</span> have failed!

<span class="i">I</span> have failed! For every sleep cycle since <span
class="i">I</span> last wrote <span class="i">I</span>'ve woken up ~30 minutes
late.

## What <span class="i">I</span>'ll change

<span class="i">I</span> think this is because <span class="i">I</span> don't
have something immediately requiring my attention when <span class="i">I</span>
wake up. <span class="i">I</span>t might be good to write a task before going to
sleep that should be worked on immediately when <span class="i">I</span> wake
up.

Yesterday <span class="i">I</span> realized my alarm has logs, so that will be
included in each post now on.

There aren't enough daylight hours currently so <span class="i">I</span> will
start shifting my sleep phases closer to night time.

At my work we have a practice proclaiming `I have failed`
at the top of our lungs whenever we can't complete something, then the whole
team claps in support. This is cheesy in practice, but surprisingly effective at
creating a supportive environment for when we fail at something. <span
class="i">I</span>'d like to carry that into wherever <span class="i">I</span>
go, and in the spirit of it <span class="i">I</span> will always explain
anything <span class="i">I</span> fail to do from the previous posts at the top
of each post.

## Word Challenge

<span class="i">I</span> was reading through a post on medium and realized the
word "<span class="i">I</span>" is very common in nearly all blogs <span
class="i">I</span>'ve ever read. <span class="i">I</span>'m curious what it
would be like to write a blog post without it. Under normal circumstances <span
class="i">I</span> could choose a topic for the post that is not related to me
to easily avoid the word, but that would be cheating. What <span
class="i">I</span> want to find out is how much <span class="i">I</span> can
reduce the ratio of occurrences of "<span class="i">I</span>" to other words.
We'll see how well this works on the next post.
