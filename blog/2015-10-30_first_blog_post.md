# First blog post

This isn't my first blog post. My _first_ was back in January 2015 when I had
just arrived in San Fransisco. The city was so full of new things I needed to
document I sat down in a black bean bag and started writing. It so felt good to
write I decided I would chronicle my adventures once per week.

That was the only week I wrote.

I want to hold myself accountable to my commitment this time by committing each
blog entry in a repo. (There's probably a committing joke somewhere in there)

Here are my constraints:

1. Each blog post must contain at least 200 words.
2. Each blog post must be committed within 12 hours of the day it is written.

Anything not set in the constraints is free and open to change.

For the next 30 days I'll use this blog to document my triphasic sleep pattern.
It has been over a year since I last tried out this sleep pattern and I expect
it to be a fun challenge as well as good starting topic for this blog.

The largest benefit to a triphasic sleep pattern is the amount of time saved.
Right now I have to spend large amounts of time on work, but that work can be
done at any time during the day. A triphasic sleep cycle, with it's increase in
waking hours of the day, can help me finish my work in a more timely and
efficient manner.

I first started experimenting with sleep patterns when trying to get through all
36 hours without sleeping for over 45 minutes at a time during my first
hackathon, hackTECH.

Full of post-hackathon euphoria, I jumped into a biphasic sleep schedule the day
hackTECH ended. This conflicted with high school classes, so I changed my
schedule and took politics as an online class. This period was like a dream.
Seeing people 'hacking' pieces of technology for fun, then having a chance to
'hack' my own schedule was an empowering experience that helped keep committed
to the sleep pattern.
